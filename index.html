    <br /><br />Gene drive alleles can bias their inheritance to rapidly spread through a population. They can modify the 
    population with a desired trait or even directly suppress the population. The most promising application for gene drives 
    is combating vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue. "Cargos" that could be carried by gene drives to prevent 
    transmission of these diseases already exist. Gene drives could also be used for conservation by removing invasive species 
    or modifying endangered species to protect them. However, substantial challenges must be overcome to develop effective drives.<br />&nbsp;
    
    <br />A primary obstacle to successful gene drive is the formation of resistance alleles by the drive itself. In most organisms, 
    obtaining high efficiency drives is also difficult. Another challenge for gene drives is to spread in only a specific target population, 
    rather than spreading uncontrollably. This could be necessary for a variety of reasons such as sociopolitical considerations or the need 
    to suppress an invasive species only outside its native range. To address these issues, the Champer lab tests gene drive concepts and 
    designs in the model organism, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. There is also research toward generating &ldquo;release candidates&rdquo; in 
    mosquitoes and other organisms.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />&#8203;A portion of the Champer lab&rsquo;s research involves computational modeling of gene
    drives to determine how well they may actually perform in natural populations. Suppression drive and confined drive
    systems have

    assess drive variants and performance models prior to conducting experiments, which are then used to further refine
    quantitative mechanistic models.<font color="#2a2a2a" size="3"><br />&#8203;</font> <br /><br />
