<div class="paragraph"><strong style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Prospective Graduate Students</strong><br /><br />Graduate students can specialize in only experimental research, only computational research, or a mixture of both. Interested students are welcome to apply to the Ph.D. program
    at Peking University in the School of Life Sciences (SLS), the Peking-Tsinghua joint Center for Life Sciences (CLS), and the Peking University-Tsinghua University-National Institute Biological Sciences (PTN) joint program. The application deadlines for these programs are usually in 
    May-June for admission in the following year. However, the CLS also has a March application deadline for the same year (this application deadline tends to be very competitive), and the international program for the SLS has a deadline in February for the same year.<br /><br />
    
    For the incoming class of 2025, one SLS and one PTN slots are available, but CLS slots are not likely to be available. Students interested in only rotations are welcome for all programs.<br /><br />

    Note that the Peking University School of Life Sciences does not have a master's degree program. CSC Scholarship letters of acceptance are conditional based on acceptance into a PhD program and will only be written in special circumstances.<br /><br />
    
    &#8203;Graduate students who are interested in
    rotating in the Champer lab are invited to E-mail Jackson <span

    <strong>Postdoctoral Positions</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /> Applications for postdoctoral positions in the
    Champer lab are welcome. We are currently mostly focusing on candidates with experience in mosquito egg microinjection for knock-ins. Postdocs can be experimental or computational, and
    it is possible to work in both areas. The starting time for these positions is highly flexible, so interested applicants are encouraged to contact Jackson early when possible (even over a year in advance of the starting time).<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Requirements<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />
    Applicants should have a Ph.D. in biology or any other scientific or quantitative field.<br />
    
    &nbsp;<br />Postdocs interested in experimental research should
    preferably have experience in molecular cloning and either fly or mosquito handling (or another insect that you would like to work with). Experience in insect egg microinjection is also desirable.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />Postdocs interested in computational research should have a solid background in at least one programming language, such as Python, R, or C++, and
    preferably experience in population modeling with simulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />All applicants should have adequate English skills.<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Instructions<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To apply for a position, please
    send your CV/resume and a cover letter (in English) to Jackson Champer (jchamper@pku.edu.cn). Applicants with fellowships should
    mention this in their cover letter.<br />&nbsp;<br />Optionally, applicants may send a short project proposal (which
    may be particularly important if applicants do not have experience in any of the stated areas
    above).<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Additional Information<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Questions about the lab and the positions
    are welcome (jchamper@pku.edu.cn).
