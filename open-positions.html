<div class="paragraph"><strong style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Prospective Graduate Students</strong><br /><br />Graduate students can specialize in only experimental research, only computational research, or a mixture of both. Interested students are welcome to apply to the Ph.D. program
    at Peking University in the School of Life Sciences (SLS), the Peking-Tsinghua joint Center for Life Sciences (CLS), and the Peking University-Tsinghua University-National Institute Biological Sciences (PTN) joint program. The application deadlines for these programs are usually in 
    May-June for admission in the following year. However, the CLS also has a March application deadline for the same year (this applicationd eadline tends to be very competitive).<br /><br />
    
    For the incoming classes of 2023 and 2024, CLS and PTN program slots are available. For the incoming 2024 SLS class, the situation is less clear, though a zebrafish collaboration project may be available. Students interested in only rotations are welcome for all programs.<br /><br />

    Note that the Peking University School of Life Sciences does not have a master's degree program. Also, students must usually be admitted to the PhD program before they can be considered for CSC Scholarship letters.<br /><br />
    
    &#8203;Graduate students who are interested in
    rotating in the Champer lab are invited to E-mail Jackson <span

        who are interested in joining the Champer lab for either experimental or computational research (or both) should send their CV
        to Jackson (jchamper@pku.edu.cn). Questions about the lab or the research&nbsp;</span><span

    <strong>Postdoctoral Positions</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /> Applications for postdoctoral positions in the
    Champer lab are welcome. We are currently focusing on candidates with experience in mosquito egg microinjection for knock-ins, but all applications will be considered. Postdocs can be experimental or computational, though
    people interested in both areas of research are also welcome. The starting time for these positions is highly flexible, 
    so interested applicants are encouraged to contact Jackson early when possible (even over a year in advance of the starting time).<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Requirements<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />
    Applicants should
    have a Ph.D. in biology or any other scientific or quantitative field.<br />
    
    &nbsp;<br />Postdocs interested in experimental research should
    preferably have experience in molecular cloning and either fly or mosquito handling (or another insect that you would like to work with). Experience in insect egg microinjection is also desirable.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />Postdocs interested in computational research should have a solid background in at least one programming language, such as Python, R, or C++, and
    preferably experience in population modeling with simulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />All applicants should have adequate
    English skills.<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Instructions<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To apply for a position, please
    send your CV/resume and a cover letter (in English) to Jackson Champer (jchamper@pku.edu.cn). Applicants with fellowships should
    mention this in their cover letter.<br />&nbsp;<br />Optionally, applicants may send a short project proposal (which
    may be particularly important if applicants do not have experience in any of the stated areas
    above).<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Additional Information<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Questions about the lab and the positions
    are welcome (jchamper@pku.edu.cn).
