    <strong>Postdoctoral Positions</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Postdoctoral positions are available in the
    Champer lab at Peking University in the School of Life Sciences and the joint Center for Life Sciences. Jackson
    Champer is scheduled to open the lab in early 2021. Lab members can be experimental or computational, though
    individuals interested in both areas of research are also welcome. The starting time for these positions is highly flexible, 
    so interested applicants are encouraged to contact Jackson early on (even over a year in advance).<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Lab
        Overview<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />The main initial topic of the lab will be CRISPR gene drive. This type of allele
    can bias inheritance in its favor, potentially allowing it to spread throughout a population. There are many
    possible applications, such as spreading genes in mosquitoes that prevent transmission of malaria, dengue, and other
    diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year. Gene drive can even be used for conservation
    purposes, such as suppression of invasive species. The lab will likely be pursuing additional related topics in the
    near future.<br />&nbsp;<br />Initial goals of the lab will be:<br />1. To develop new types of gene drives using
    the fruit fly as a model organism.<br />2. To develop highly efficient gene drives that avoid
    &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; in mosquitoes.<br />3. To use computational modeling to assess how well gene drives will
    actually perform in real-world environments.<br />&nbsp;<br />The general lab philosophy is to provide a friendly
    and supportive environment to help individuals be productive and achieve their career
    goals.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Application Requirements<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Applicants should
    have a Ph.D. in biology or any other scientific or quantitative field.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Experimental postdocs should
    preferably have experience in molecular cloning and either fly or mosquito handling.<br />&nbsp;<br />Computational
    postdocs should have a solid background in at least one programming language, such as Python, R, or C++, and
    preferably experience in population modeling with simulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />All applicants should have adequate
    English skills.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Application Instructions<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To apply for a position, please
    send your CV/resume and a cover letter (in English) to Jackson Champer (jc3248@cornell.edu). Applicants with fellowships should
    mention this in their cover letter.<br />&nbsp;<br />Optionally, applicants may send a short project proposal (which
    may be particularly important if applicants do not have experience in any of the stated areas
    above).<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Additional Information<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Questions about the lab and the positions
    are welcome (jc3248@cornell.edu).<br />&nbsp;<br />
