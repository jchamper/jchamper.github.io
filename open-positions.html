<div class="paragraph"><strong style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Prospective Graduate Students</strong><br /><br />Interested students are welcome to apply to the Ph.D. program at Peking University in the School of Life Sciences (SLS), the
    Peking-Tsinghua joint Center for Life Sciences (CLS), and the Peking University-Tsinghua University-National
    Institute Biological Sciences (PTN) joint program.<br /><br />
    
   For the incoming classes of 2023 and 2024, CLS and PTN program slots are available, but SLS slots are not likely to be available. Students interested in only rotations are still welcome.<br /><br />

    Graduate students can specialize in only experimental research, only computational research, or a mixture of both.<br />
    
    <br />&#8203;Graduate students who are interested in
    rotating in the Champer lab are invited to E-mail Jackson <span

        Undergraduate Students</strong><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Motivated undergraduate students
        who are interested in joining the Champer lab for either experimental or computational research (or both) should send their CV
        and transcript to Jackson (jchamper@pku.edu.cn). Questions about the lab or the research&nbsp;</span><span

    classes.<br /><br /><br />

    <strong>Postdoctoral Positions</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /> Applications for postdoctoral positions in the
    Champer lab will be considered. Postdocs can be experimental or computational, though
    people interested in both areas of research are also welcome. The starting time for these positions is highly flexible, 
    so interested applicants are encouraged to contact Jackson early when possible (even over a year in advance of the starting time).<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Requirements<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />
    Applicants should
    have a Ph.D. in biology or any other scientific or quantitative field.<br />
    
    &nbsp;<br />Experimental postdocs should
    preferably have experience in molecular cloning and either fly or mosquito handling (or another insect that you would like to work with). Experience in insect egg microinjection is also desirable.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />Computational
    postdocs should have a solid background in at least one programming language, such as Python, R, or C++, and
    preferably experience in population modeling with simulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />All applicants should have adequate
    English skills.<br />&nbsp;<br />
    
    <em>Application Instructions<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To apply for a position, please
    send your CV/resume and a cover letter (in English) to Jackson Champer (jchamper@pku.edu.cn). Applicants with fellowships should
    mention this in their cover letter.<br />&nbsp;<br />Optionally, applicants may send a short project proposal (which
    may be particularly important if applicants do not have experience in any of the stated areas
    above).<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Additional Information<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Questions about the lab and the positions
    are welcome (jchamper@pku.edu.cn).
