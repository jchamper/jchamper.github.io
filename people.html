                <strong>Jackson Champer</strong> was born in 1986 in New York City. He received a B.S. in physics and
                mathematics from
                the
                University of Oregon and a M.S. in physics from UCLA. Jackson then switched his focus to biology,
                receiving
                a Ph.D. from City of Hope Beckman Research Institute in 2015. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell
